### Why I decided to do this talk ?
- Previously I used to think Jenkins can be compromised in two possible ways
   - Exploit CVE
   - Execute a Groovy Script in Script Console.
- I had an opinion if these two conditions are met then Jenkins is secure.
- Sharing my observations how Jenkins is being used by various teams and studying those internet exposed Jenkins instances ( nearly 1000 of them ). 

### 3 things about this talk
- In this talk we are NOT going to exploit any CVE !
- We will learn about jenkins internals, features and misconfigurations.
- We will focus exploiting point 2 !
