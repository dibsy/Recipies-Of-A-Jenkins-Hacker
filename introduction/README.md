# Introduction

### Whoami
- Dibyendu SIKDAR
- CTF Player, Penetration Tester, Security Engineer
- Work in Umbrella Engineering ( CISCO France )

### Why I decided to do this talk ?
- Previously I used to think Jenkins can be compromised in two possible ways
   - Exploit CVE
   - Execute a Groovy Script in Script Console.
- I had an opinion if either or both of these conditions are *NOT* met then Jenkins is secure.
- I studied otherâ€™s research work and performed my own research for exploiting Jenkins and then I had my opinions flip.
- I looked into how devops teams use jenkins & studied those exposed internet Jenkins controllers.
- Hence I decided to share my observations & learning & techniques of security misconfiguration and exploiting Jenkins!


### 3 things about this talk
- In this talk we are NOT going to exploit any CVE !
- We will learn about jenkins internals, features and misconfigurations.
- We will focus exploiting point 2 !
