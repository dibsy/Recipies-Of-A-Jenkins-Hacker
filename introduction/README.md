### Why I decided to do this talk ?
- Just 1 year ago, I used to think Jenkins can be compromised in these two ways
   - Exploit CVE
   - Execute a Groovy Script in Script Console as an admin
- The more I spent time with Jenkins, the more I realized the attack surfaces

### 3 important information for this talk
- In this talk we are NOT going to exploit any CVE !
- We will primarily focus on Jenkins behaviour and features.
- This talk is created observing the dev ways of doing things through my experience & studying those internet exposed Jenkins instances.
